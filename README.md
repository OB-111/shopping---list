# Shopping List project

This application is designed to manage shopping list products.

# workflow

I added a deletion option to every product before me that is saved
Adding products by categories and quantities to the same product

The application is used to save the shopping basket, which means that the user must create a shopping basket and edit it as he wishes,
and when he clicks on the finish order button, the shopping list will be saved in the DB and it will be possible to see the list on the screen even after a refresh .
